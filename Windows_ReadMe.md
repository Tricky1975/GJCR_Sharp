# Notes about Windows

At the present time I do not have a (real) Windows computer at my disposal. Due to that I am dependent on emulators and virtual machines or whatever to test out how things operate in Windows.
I am still investigating how to get Windows to run everything here, but I cannot yet make full instructions on this.

What I can tell is that this version of GJCR uses the .NET framework, which should work on Windows without problems or any requirement to do extra installs. Although Mono does exist for Windows, I doubt you  u need it. 

It does use the GTK Sharp framework, and I am sorting out what the best way to go is about GTK sharp. ;)
If you know more than I do, please lemme know ;)
